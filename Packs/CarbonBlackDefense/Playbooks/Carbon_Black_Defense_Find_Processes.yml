        Use this playbook as a sub-playbook to block execution of the master playbook until a remote action is complete.
        This playbook implements polling by continuously running the command in Step \#2 until the operation completes.
        The remote action should have the following structure:

        1. Initiate the operation.
        2. Poll to check if the operation completed.
        3. (optional) Get the results of the operation.
