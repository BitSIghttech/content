##### Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus v2
- Added new commands for server versions 6.2.0+: ***autofocus-search-samples-with-results*** and ***autofocus-search-sessions-with-results***.
  The new commands allow users to search autofocus with a single command, that doesn't require ***GenericPolling Playbook***.
