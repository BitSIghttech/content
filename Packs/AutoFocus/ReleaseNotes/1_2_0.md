##### Palo Alto Networks AutoFocus v2
- Added new arguments ***with_results*** to the commands ***autofocus-search-samples*** and ***autofocus-search-sessions***. When ***with_results*** is used, the command will try to return the results.
  The new commands allow users to search autofocus with a single command, that doesn't require ***GenericPolling Playbook***.
